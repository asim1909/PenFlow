## üîß Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up PenFlow locally:

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (either locally installed or a remote instance)

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/asim1909/penflow.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd penflow
    ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up the environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_
    ```

    Make sure to replace `your_database_uri_here` with your actual MongoDB URI and `your_jwt_secret_here` with a secure secret key for JWT.

5. Start the application:

   - **Frontend** (run this in one terminal):
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
